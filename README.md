 
 # Philips Hue c8y Agent

Cumulocity micro service agent to connect and play with your Philips Hue bridge and lights.
Developed using the [Software AG webMethods Micro Service Runtime](https://hub.docker.com/_/softwareag-webmethods-microservicesruntime).

This agent uses the [Philips MeetHue API](https://developers.meethue.com)

The agent provides an onboarding API that is documented via the packages own home directory accessible once you have installed the package via /c8yPhilipsHueAgent, 
[online](https://raw.githack.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent/main/pub/index.html) and also briefly documented below. The agent will automatically send metrics and process operations,
once the agent has been deployed and you have successfully onboarded a Hue bridge.

**Installation**

This source code is a webMethods Micro Service Runtime package and you will need to first install the Software AG Micro Service Runtime or download a docker image.

**local installation**

If you have an Integration Server or Micro Service Runtime running locally for development purposes, first navigate to your packages directory;

*$ cd /${SAG_HOME}/IntegrationServer/packages*  
or  
*$ cd /${SAG_HOME}/IntegrationServer/instances/${INSTANCE}/packages*  

If your packages directory is already under version control

*$ git submodule add https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent.git c8yPhilipsHueAgent*

or if you are not, then simply clone the repository

*$ git clone https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent.git*  

Then download dependent packages

*$ git clone https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yConnector.git*  
*$ git clone https://github.com/johnpcarter/JcPublicTools.git*  

Then restart your runtime server and refresh your package browser in Designer.

**Docker Installation**

A predefined Dockerfile template has been provided in the c8yConnector packages resources directory. It is recommended that you copy the directory
and then update Dockerfile and aclmap_sm.cnf file appropriately.

cd into your directory and download the latest source code

*$ cd ${WORKING_DIR}*  
*$ git clone https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent.git*  
*$ git clone https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yConnector.git*  
*$ git clone https://github.com/johnpcarter/JcPublicTools.git*  

copy the permissions file from the c8yPhilipsHueAgent into your directory

$ cp ./C8yPhilipsHueAgent/resources/aclmap_sm.cnf .  

Update the docker file to include the c8yPhilipsHueAgent package by copying the following line into the section 'add YOUR packages here'

*ADD --chown=sagadmin ./c8yPhilipsHueAgent /opt/softwareag/IntegrationServer/packages/c8yPhilipsHueAgent*  

You could also choose to include your MSR license file by adding the following line

*ADD --chown=sagadmin .licenseKey.xml /opt/softwareag/IntegrationServer/config/licenseKey.xml*  

You can now build your image

*$ docker build -t ${YOUR DOCKER IMAGE} .*  

**Preparing the Micro Service zip file for your tenant**

You will need to export the newly build image as a tar file and then zip it with the provided cumulocity.json file before uploading to your tenant

*$ docker save -o image.tar ${YOUR DOCKER IMAGE}*  
*$ zip ${c8y_app_name} cumulocity.json image.tar*

**Uploading the Micro Service agent to your Cumulocity tenant**

Login in to your Cumulocity tenant and select the "Administration" app, then from the left hand side menu "Applications", "Own Applications" and then click "Add application". Choose "Upload microservice"and select the zip that you created before.

Once uploaded, subscribe to the app in order to start it up and activate it.

For more information refer to the Cumulocity documentation on [Micro Service Runtime](https://cumulocity.com/guides/microservice-sdk/concept/#microservice-runtime)

**Starting up the agent remotely**

You can also use the agent from your own development environment or run the docker image outside of your tenant if you wish.
You will need to set the bootstrap credentials or set the c8y user in your local environment.

You can obtain your bootstrap credentials via the following api call

*$ curl "https://<TENTANT_NAME>.cumulocity.com/application/applications/<APP_ID>/bootstrapUser" \
 -u '<YOUR_USER>:<YOUR_PASSWORD>'*

From your local environment, run the service

*jc.cumulocity.tools.app:setCredentials*  

and either provide your own credentials via the C8Y_TENANT, C8Y_USER and C8Y_PASSWORD inputs, or you want to use the app credential provide 
the 'C8Y_BOOSTRAP_TENANT', 'C8Y_BOOTSTRAP_USER' and 'C8Y_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD' inputs. Reload the package afterwards if you want the package to automatically 
send metrics and process operations for your lights.

If you want to run the docker image independently then set the following environment variables when starting up the container

*-e C8Y_BOOTSTRAP_TENANT=''*
*-e C8Y_BOOTSTRAP_USER=''*
*-e C8Y_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD=''*

**Remote authentication required by Philips Hue**

 You will need to use the following settings to obtain an OAuth 2.0 token for your Hue bridge.
  
 *authorization: https://api.meethue.com/oauth2/auth?appid=cumulocity_device_manager&deviceid=c8y&device_name=c8y&response_type=code*
 
 *access: https://api.meethue.com/oauth2/token*
  
 You can register for a client id/secret via the developer site above and also find documentation on how to authenticate and obtain a token
 
 [Remote API Quick Start Guide](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api/remote-api-quick-start-guide)
 
**Device Onboarding**

  Once you have your OAuth 2.0 token, you can begin the onboarding process for the bridge and its attached lights and switches.
  
  1) *get /bridge/{name}/definition*  
  Queries your hue bridge and returns a c8y managed object representing it. If the managed object has not yet been posted (id will be null/nil) then 
  post it to c8y.
  2) *post /bridge/{c8yIdOfBridge}/provision*  
  Queries the hue bridge via the user and token associated with the managed object created in the previous step and creates child device for all of the lights and switches 
  attached to the bridge. On successful completion the agent will start sending metrics and listening for operations.
  
  Supported operations are '*c8y_Relay*' and '*c8y_Property_dimmer*'. Refer to this package's [online documentation](http://localhost:5555/c8yPhilipsHueAgent) 
  for detailed documentation on its API, or you can it view it [via githack](https://raw.githack.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent/main/pub/index.html)
  
**Agent Configuration files**

  This agent also defines a managed object of type '**c8y_Device_Agent**' in Cumulocity, which formally defines the above onboarding process so that third party apps
  can leverage this agent without hard-coding. The OAuth 2.0 client id/secret parameters are also defined via a managed object with the type '**philips-api**'.
  You can update these default settings by modifying the resource files [c8y_provisioning_model.json](https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent/blob/main/resources/c8y_provisioning_model.json),
  and [c8y_default_provider.json](https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent/blob/main/resources/c8y_default_provider.json) or by adding your own managed objects via the c8y API.
  
  These managed objects are leveraged by my own iOS "Device Management" app to ensure seamless device onboarding without requiring any hard-coding.
    
**Device Models**

  Device models and images for Philips hue assets are also registered via the types '**device_Supplier**' and '**device_Model**' respectively, which can be found at 
  [philips-hue_supplier.json](https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent/blob/main/resources/philips-hue_supplier.json) and [device_models](https://github.com/johnpcarter/c8yPhilipsHueAgent/blob/main/resources/device_models)
